# demofinder

## project goals

Democracy needs transparency.
As more and more demonstrations occur worldwide, there should be an easy way to find them.
Demofinder aims to be an opensource tool to allow everybody to inform themselves about planned demonstrations in their area.
Demofinder will also allow reporting of demonstrations.
Depending on the adoption rate it might progress into a demonstration management tool.
